<p>Precious Plastic is a project started by Dave Hakkens. It was originally started as his graduation project at the Design Academy in 2013. Back then it was a proof of concept, something that worked as a prototype but was not ready for scaling it up yet. The machines needed to be developed properly. Easier to build, using basic tools and universal materials. Version 2.0.</p>

<p>However itâ€™s been on hold for a while because of his other project: Phonebloks. In order to get Precious Plastic going he put a request online asking for a machine builder to help. Kees replied and the project rebooted. The development started again, some other great people joined the project as well, and everyone contributed their expertise. After working 2 years on it, it's ready for the world. A solid version of machines, instructional videos, and blueprints shared open-source for free. A complete package that enables people to start recycling.</p>
