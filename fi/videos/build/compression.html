<h2>About the compressor</h2>
<p>Plastic is heated inside the oven and slowly pressed into a mold with a carjack. Well suited for making large and more solid objects. The oven itself is also a great machine for prototyping and making plastic tests.</p>

<h2>Technical drawings</h2>
<p>You can find all the technical drawings to build this machine in our  <a href="/{{page.lang}}/videos/download/">download-kit</a>. They are divided into different steps and contain all the dimensions you need to build the machine. </p>

<h2>3D overview</h2>
<p>Below you can find a 3D visual of the machine, just to give you a basic understanding how it works, click the button to turn it around. Detailed CAD drawings can be found in the download-kit.</p>

<h2>Creations</h2>
<p>The compressor is pretty basic, it heats and presses plastic into a mold. It totally depends on your mold what the output will be. It’s easy to make little bowls and containers. However you can also turn it into flat sheets or solid objects which you could use as a starting point for working with conventional tools.</p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things you can do with this machine, you could customize it or make completely new molds we couldn’t even imagine. In our forums you can share your hacks and creations. The most interesting and useful ones are shared on our <a href="/{{page.lang}}/videos/extra/">extra</a> page. Below you can see a few creations for this machine.</p>
