<h2>About injection molding</h2>
<p>Plastic flakes are heated and injected into a mold. It’s a relatively quick process which is well suited for creating small objects repeatedly. You can make the molds yourself using CNC mills or lathes, or by simply welding them.</p>

<h2>Technical drawings</h2>
<p>You can find all the technical drawings to build this machine in our  <a href="/{{page.lang}}/videos/download/">download-kit</a>. They are divided into different steps and contain all the dimensions you need to build the machine. </p>

<h2>3D overview</h2>
<p>Below you can find a 3D visual of the machine, just to give you a basic understanding how it works, click the button to turn it around. Detailed CAD drawings can be found in the download-kit.</p>

<h2>Creations</h2>
<p>This injection molding machine is well suited for making small detailed objects. Put some effort into your mold once and it will pay off in the end. Since it works with molds you can easily replicate it and set up a production.</p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things you can do with this machine, you could customize it or make completely new molds we couldn’t even imagine. In our forums you can share your hacks and creations. The most interesting and useful ones are shared on our <a href="/{{page.lang}}/videos/extra/">extra</a> page. Below you can see a few creations for this machine</p>
