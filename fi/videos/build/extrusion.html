<h2>About extrusion</h2>
<p>
Extrusion is a continuous process where plastic flakes are inserted into the hopper and extruded into a line of plastic. These lines can be used to make new raw materials such as 3d printing filament, make granulated plastic, spinned around a mold, or used by you in new and creative ways.</p>

<h2>Technical drawings</h2>
<p>You can find all the technical drawings to build this machine in our  <a href="/{{page.lang}}/videos/download/">download-kit</a>. They are divided into different steps and contain all the dimensions you need to build the machine. </p>

<h2>3D overview</h2>
<p>Below you can find a 3D visual of the machine, just to give you a basic understanding how it works, click the button to turn it around. Detailed CAD drawings can be found in the download-kit.</p>

<h2>Creations</h2>
<p>The extrusion machine has quite a specific output, a line. This is well suited to make new granulate and 3D printer filament. However, use your creativity and you will find other applications for it as well. Change the nozzle for different shapes and sizes, turn it around a mold to make lamps or a handle for a knife. </p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things you can do with this machine, you could customize it or make completely new molds we couldn’t even imagine. In our forums you can share your hacks and creations. The most interesting and useful ones are shared on our <a href="/{{page.lang}}/videos/extra/">extra</a> page. Below you can see a few creations for this machine.</p>
