<h2>General</h2>

<p>Unfortunately we arenâ€™t able to answer all of your questions. We wish we could reply to everyone but we don't have enough resources to do that. We are just a tiny group of people working on this. Feel free to make a <a href="https://davehakkens.nl/donate/preciousplastic/ "target="_blank">donation</a>, so that one day we might have a support-guy in our team</p>

<h2>Community</h2>

<p>The forum is the main place where we and others share project developments and hacks. If you have any questions, ideas, or suggestions, post them there. Other members or some of us can help you out. This helps to improve the knowledge database and avoid double questions.</p>
