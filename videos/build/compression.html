<h2>About the compression</h2>
<p>Plastic is heated inside the oven and slowly pressed into a mold with a carjack. Well suited to make large and more solid objects,. The oven itself is also a great machine for prototyping and making plastic test.</p>

<h2>Technical drawings</h2>
<p>You can find all the technical drawings to build this machine in our <a href="/videos/download/">download-kit</a>. They are divided into different steps and contain all the dimensions you need to build to machine. </p>

<h2>3D overview</h2>
<p>Below you can find a 3D visual of the machine, just to give you a basic understanding how it works, click to button to turn it around. Detailed CAD drawings can be found in the download-kit.</p>

<h2>Creations</h2>
<p>The compression machine is pretty basic, it heats and presses plastic in a mold. It totally depends on your mold what the output will be. It’s easy to little bowls and containers. However you can also turn it into flat sheets or solid objects which you could use as a starting point for working with conventional tools.</p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things you can do with this machine, you could customize it or make completely different molds we wouldn’t thought about. In our forums you can share your hacks and creations. The most interesting and useful ones are shared on our <a href="/videos/extra/">extra</a> page. Below a few creations that match this machine</p>
