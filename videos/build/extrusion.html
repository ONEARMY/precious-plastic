<h2>About the extrusion</h2>
<p>A continues process where plastic flakes are inserted in the hopper and extruded into a line of plastic. These lines can be used to make new raw material like 3d printer filament, granulate or find your own creative way and spin it around a mold.</p>

<h2>Technical drawings</h2>
<p>You can find all the technical drawings to build this machine in our <a href="/videos/download/">download-kit</a>. They are divided into different steps and contain all the dimensions you need to build to machine. </p>

<h2>3D overview</h2>
<p>Below you can find a 3D visual of the machine, just to give you a basic understanding how it works, click to button to turn it around. Detailed CAD drawings can be found in the download-kit.</p>

<h2>Creations</h2>
<p>The extrusion machine has quite a specific output, a line. This is well suited to make new granulate and 3D printer filament. However use your creativity and you will find other applications for it as well. Change the nozzle for different shapes and sizes, turn it around a mold to make lamps or a handle for a knife. </p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things you can do with this machine, you could customize it or make completely different molds we wouldn’t thought about. In our forums you can share your hacks and creations. The most interesting and useful ones are shared on our <a href="/videos/extra/">extra</a> page. Below a few creations that match this machine</p>
