<p>I wanted to use this space of the web to personally thank everyone that is/was involved in the project so far. Precious Plastic wouldn’t be the same without these heroes contributing with their expertise.<br />Big special thanks to you guys!</p>

    <p>Yes, the Dutch machine builder that replied to the video! He ended up putting way more of his time into the project. He is the reason the machines are rock-solid.</p>
