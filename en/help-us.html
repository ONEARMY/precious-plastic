    <h1>Donate</h1>
    <p>Everything we do and make is shared open source online, for free. Your <a href="https://davehakkens.nl/donate/preciousplastic/" target="_blank">donations</a> push this project ahead. They mean a lot to us.</p>

    <h1>Build machines</h1>
    <p>It makes us happy when you build the machines locally. We know this isn’t for everyone though, so as a non-builder you can also help out in our forums where we're trying to connect people with machine builders.</p>
