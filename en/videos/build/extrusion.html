<h2>About the extrusion</h2>
<p>
Extrusion is a continuous process where plastic flakes are inserted in the hopper and extruded into a line of plastic. These lines can be used to make new raw material (3d printing filament), granulate, spinned around a mold or up to you to find new creative ways.</p>

<h2>Technical drawings</h2>
<p>You can find all the technical drawings to build this machine in our  <a href="/videos/download/">download-kit</a>. They are divided into different steps and contain all the dimensions you need to build the machine. </p>

<h2>3D overview</h2>
<p>Below you can find a 3D visual of the machine, just to give you a basic understanding how it works, click to button to turn it around. Detailed CAD drawings can be found in the download-kit.</p>

<h2>Creations</h2>
<p>The extrusion machine has quite a specific output, a line. This is well suited to make new granulate and 3D printer filament. However use your creativity and you will find other applications for it as well. Change the nozzle for different shapes and sizes, turn it around a mold to make lamps or a handle for a knife. </p>

<h2>Customizations</h2>
<p>There are a lot of things you can do with this machine, you could customize it or make completely new molds we wouldn’t even imagine. In our forums you can share your hacks and creations. The most interesting and useful ones are shared on our <a href="/videos/extra/">extra</a> page. Below you can see a few creations for this machine</p>
